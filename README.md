## Background

This assignment is designed to familiarize you with creating layouts using CSS flexbox, as well as creating a fully-styled website.

&nbsp;
## Setup

Create a git repository titled `m6-hw6-lastname-firstname` and clone the repo to your computer. For this assignment, you may copy over your previous assignment files and then refactor your CSS, or you may choose to start over without using your previous code.

&nbsp;
## Instructions

1. Using [the included mockup](mockup-1920.png), create a portfolio website about yourself. Although the mockup looks like it has three total pages, you are only responsible for creating the home/about me page as depicted in the mockup.
1. In order to receive full-credit, your site must include:
    1. A header with your name and navigation links for "about", "portfolio", and "contact".
    1. A main content section with "about me" text that wraps around a profile image.
        * If you do not wish to use an image of yourself, [you may use a placeholder](https://pravatar.cc/).
        * You may use [lorem text](https://uhded.com/automatic-generate-lorem-vscode) for the site's copy if you wish instead of writing your own biographical info.
    1. A background pattern image applied behind the main content.
        * See [Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/) or [Hero Patterns](https://www.heropatterns.com/) for free patterns.
    1. A sidebar to the right of the main text that includes social media icon links for [Stack Overflow](assets/soverflow.png), [LinkedIn](assets/linkedin.png), and [GitHub](assets/git.png)
    1. A footer at the bottom of the page that includes your name.
1. **You must use CSS Flexbox to create your layout.** Do not use CSS floats outside of wrapping text around a picture.
1. Your markup must use proper semantic tags.
1. Your site must be deployed to GitHub pages.

**NOTE**: Your site's design may deviate from the mockup with regards to colors and fonts. However, you must maintain the same layout as shown in the mockup.

&nbsp;
## Deployment

Your code must be deployed to GitHub Pages. To deploy a repository to GitHub pages you must:

1. Ensure your repository has an `index.html` file in the root directory.
1. Navigate to the `settings` section of the repository.
1. Click on `pages` in the left navigation menu.
1. Under `source` click the dropdown and select your `master` or `main` branch.
1. Click `save`.

Your site should be deployed to `<your github username>.github.io/<your repository name>` in 5-10 minutes.

## Submission

Please submit both a link to your repository and a link to the live site. Also please include any comments on stumbling blocks or difficulties encountered while completing the assignment.
